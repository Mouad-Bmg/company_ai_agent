# company_ai_agent
AI-powered company assistant that answers questions by retrieving information from company documents. It uses vector search to locate the most relevant content and an AI model to generate clear, contextual responses.

This project implements an intelligent chatbot designed to provide accurate answers and insights about a company.

## Overview

The agent processes user questions and combines two key capabilities:

• Semantic search with vector embeddings: Company documents (e.g. PDFs containing detailed internal information) are transformed into embeddings and stored in a vector database. When a question is asked, the agent retrieves the most relevant passages.
• Natural language generation: An AI model interprets both the user query and the retrieved context to generate a clear and precise response.

## Key Features

• Conversational interface that understands natural language.
• Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipeline for precise answers grounded in company data.
• Memory system to maintain context across interactions.
• Modular design, making it adaptable to new document sources or data formats.

## Purpose

This agent serves as a reliable knowledge interface for company data. Instead of searching through lengthy documents, users can ask questions directly and receive structured, context-aware answers.
